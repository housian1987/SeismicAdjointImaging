# Seismic Adjoint Imaging
This is a small program to perform seismic finite difference simulation and adjoint imaging.

Now, we have 2d aoucstic finite difference modeling and rtm. We hope to update fwi lsrtm in future.

To run our programs, I recommend you don't use OpenMP and MPI simultaneously, so copy the corresponding make.inc and change the compiler at first.

You can see the instruction of each program when run it without parameters.

If you have any problem, contact me by E-mail, sianhou1987@outlook.com, freely.

Best wishes!

Problems:
We are developing imaging domain inversion now;
We hope to add denstiy equation;
We hope to improve elastic simulation: improve dxdz; improve source;
