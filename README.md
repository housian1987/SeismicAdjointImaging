# sgxyz
This is a small program to run seismic finite difference simulation and RTM.

To run our programs, I recommend you don't use OpenMP and MPI simultaneously, so copy the corresponding make.inc and change the compiler at first.

You can see the instruction of each program when run it without parameters.

If you have any problem, contact me by E-mail, sianhou1987@outlook.com, freely.


Best wishes!
